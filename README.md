# Lemizh constellations
The folder _Web_ contains the code for the [celestial sphere](https://lemizh.conlang.org/appendix/constell/webgl.php) and [constellation list](https://lemizh.conlang.org/appendix/constell.php) in my conworld Lemizh.

The folder _LemStars_ contains the software used to create and edit the data files on which the web application relies. It is written in FreePascal on Lazarus.

Published in the hope that someone who wants to create a 3D interactive celestial sphere for web browsers might find it useful.

['Eagle','ftnÌk.','','Aquila','This is the [[Wise One]]’s eagle (Aquila in our nomenclature), and the symbol of his pride. He is depicted as flying to the northeast along the street of snow (the Milky Way) to meet the [[Prince]]. The Wise One’s other animal is the [[Serpent]].¶¶According to another legend, this is the eagle of Zeus, who is about to capture the [[Merman]] to make him the gods’ cupbearer.'],
['Princess','textbè.','taxt.','Andromeda, Triangulum & Lacerta','The Princess, more or less corresponding to Andromeda in our tradition, is the [[Queen]]’s daughter. She is depicted sitting at the eastern end of the constellation with her gown flowing west. She gave the [[Prince]] two departure presents for his quest: a mask and a dead snake.¶¶See the [[Rosebush]] for more information.'],
['Bear','vmlÌv.','','Ursa Major','The Bear corresponds to our constellation Ursa Major, the greater bear.¶¶It is looking west; the seven bright stars of the plough or big dipper make up the small of its back and (defying biology) its tail. The rest of its body, its head ({{1367|ο Ursae Majoris or Muscida}}) and its legs can be easily seen on clear nights, making for an impressive figure.¶¶Countless stories have been associated with the Bear. In one, it used to be a nymph that was transformed by a jealous goddess. According to another, the [[Prince]] beat it in a boxing match to teach it manners.'],
['Mechanic','jhèj.','','Boötes & Corona Borealis','The Mechanic, in ancient times known as the Craftsman, is what we know as Boötes and Corona Borealis, or herdsman and northern crown. He holds the crown he has succeeded in creating in his right hand. However, the [[Serpent]] has denied him its wisdom regarding music, so he failed constructing the [[Trumpet]] – he has just thrown it over his head in exasperation, in the direction of the [[River]]. In some old star charts, his left hand holds a pendulum instead.'],
['Queen','dwecRèc.','dwac.','Cassiopeia','The Queen (Cassiopeia for us) is depicted in a sitting position, with the [[Rosebush]] at her feet.¶¶According to legend, she sent the [[Prince]] on a quest that started at her Rosebush; see there for more information.'],

['Dragon','fxÌc.','','Draco & Ursa Minor','The Dragon, or Draco in our nomenclature, is flying with his wings raised towards the North Pole, looking south at the [[Stag]] to challenge it. His left wing consists of the four stars that make up the body of Ursa Minor, the lesser bear, in our tradition.¶¶In one legend, the Dragon was defeated by a clever contraption of the Craftsman’s (now called the [[Mechanic]]); in another, he was a cursed boy who was healed by the [[Lion]].'],
['Fishes','pyskdwÌ.','pask.','Pisces','The Fishes (literally ‘two fish’) correspond to our constellation of the same name, Pisces.

['Horse','Ìhw.','','Pegasus','The Horse is usually depicted as having wings and thus equated to the mythical Pegasus; although the wings might just symbolise its swiftness. For some reason it is upside down, and ist hind parts are missing.¶¶Some say this is the [[Prince]]’s horse.'],
['River','argÌ.','','Eridanus & Fornax','This constellation coincides with our river Eridanus, flowing south.¶¶{{99|Dalim}}, the main star of the constellation Fornax (the furnace) is located in a loop of the River. It is often depicted as a house or tree at the top of a hill.'],

['Hare','xÌd.','','Lepus','The Hare, or Lepus in our star charts, is located south of the [[Hunter]]. It is facing west, fleeing from the [[Poodle]]. Three stars surrounding the image of the Hare, {{576|Sceptrum}}, {{255|ζ}} and {{118|η Leporis}}, represent bees stirred up by its flight.'],
['Poodle','oRwxÌf.','','Canis Major','The Poodle is the [[Hunter]]’s dog and corresponds to Canis Major, the greater dog. It is on its hind legs, looking northwest at its master and the fleeing [[Hare]].¶¶This is the proper breed of dog for hunting along the [[River]].'],

['Trumpet','saxùf.','','Sagitta','The Trumpet corresponds to our constellation Sagitta, the arrow. According to legend, the Craftsman (now the constellation [[Mechanic]]) threw the it across the whole sky and into the [[River]] because it didn’t sound as good as he had hoped.'],

['Serpent','RÌz.','','Serpens','This is the [[Wise One]]’s serpent (Serpens in our nomenclature), which he holds in his hands. It is the symbol of his wisdom. The Serpent’s head is at the western end; it is looking threateningly northeast towards the [[Stag]], completely ignoring the [[Mechanic]]. The Wise One’s other animal is the [[Eagle]].'],
['Archer','fkrè.','','Sagittarius','The Archer, or Sagittarius as we call this constellation, is usually depicted as a girl with an elaborate feathered headdress. She is aiming west at the [[Scorpion]], more accurately at the star Antares, which is known as the Apple Star (<span lang="x-lm" title="memthxxalè.">memqxxalè.</span>) for its reddish colour.'],
['Swan','xaxpqÌ.','','Cygnus','This is the [[King]]’s swan, which we call Cygnus.

Many of these have been identified with the Swan by classical authors.'],

In some stories, it is killed by the [[Archer]], in others, it is confronted by the [[Prince]] (who is on his quest to win the [[Princess]]’s hand), or by both. The fact that the Archer is female and also of royal blood only serves to complicate things.¶¶Antares, {{4883|α Scorpii}}, is called the Apple Star (<span lang="x-lm" title="memthxxalè.">memqxxalè.</span>) in the Lemizh tradition.'],
['Ibex','kubrÌ.','','Capricornus','The Ibex, Capricornus in our nomenclature, is actually a goat–fish hybrid that has been haunting European legends for a long time.'],

It is looking towards the viewer, one forefoot raised, horns pointing northeast.¶¶Star numbers starting with <span lang="x-lm" title="B">B</span> were originally assigned to the [[Guests]] or Pleiades, which is now a separate constellation. Therefore, there are no such numbers in the Bull.'],
['Whale-fish','gydpÌsk.','gad.','Cetus','This constellation, which corresponds to Cetus, is a sea monster whose shape is quite different from that of a whale: it has a bulky head (looking east), a slim neck, and long flippers.'],

It is holding a cup ({{1068|γ}}, {{1365|η}} and {{5987|π Aquarii}}) that is overflowing with water, soaking the last three in the [[Queue of Mice]].¶¶According to one story, the Merman was capured by the [[Eagle]] and made the gods’ cupbearer to keep him from drenching unsuspecting animals.'],

['Moth','swmilÌ.','','Canes Venatici & Coma Berenices','The Moth roughly covers the region of Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices, the hunting dogs and Berenice’s hair. It used to be seen as a swarm of moths or fireflies (the Coma Cluster) flying around the [[Mechanic]] and making fun of him. Only later the constellation has been reinterpreted as one, somewhat oversized, moth flying east.'],

Its head and antlers correspond to our constellation Lyra, its body roughly to Hercules. It is often seen as a representation of the White Stag, which will grant you a wish if you catch it, but only after it has led you into forbidden territory.¶¶The [[Dragon]] and the [[Serpent]] are looking in the direction of the (completely unfazed) Stag to challenge it, or maybe, in case of the Serpent, to avoid looking at the [[Mechanic]].'],

‹no constellation›|¤¤¤
Eagle|ftnÌk.¤¤Aquila¤This is the [[Wise One]]’s eagle (Aquila in our nomenclature), and the symbol of his pride. He is depicted as flying to the northeast along the street of snow (the Milky Way) to meet the [[Prince]]. The Wise One’s other animal is the [[Serpent]].¶¶According to another legend, this is the eagle of Zeus, who is about to capture the [[Merman]] to make him the gods’ cupbearer.
Princess|textbè.¤taxt.¤Andromeda, Triangulum & Lacerta¤The Princess, more or less corresponding to Andromeda in our tradition, is the [[Queen]]’s daughter. She is depicted sitting at the eastern end of the constellation with her gown flowing west. She gave the [[Prince]] two departure presents for his quest: a mask and a dead snake.¶¶See the [[Rosebush]] for more information.
Bear|vmlÌv.¤¤Ursa Major¤The Bear corresponds to our constellation Ursa Major, the greater bear.¶¶It is looking west; the seven bright stars of the plough or big dipper make up the small of its back and (defying biology) its tail. The rest of its body, its head ({{#10578|ο Ursae Majoris or Muscida}}) and its legs can be easily seen on clear nights, making for an impressive figure.¶¶Countless stories have been associated with the Bear. In one, it used to be a nymph that was transformed by a jealous goddess. According to another, the [[Prince]] beat it in a boxing match to teach it manners.
Mechanic|jhèj.¤¤Boötes & Corona Borealis¤The Mechanic, in ancient times known as the Craftsman, is what we know as Boötes and Corona Borealis, or herdsman and northern crown. He holds the crown he has succeeded in creating in his right hand. However, the [[Serpent]] has denied him its wisdom regarding music, so he failed constructing the [[Trumpet]] – he has just thrown it over his head in exasperation, in the direction of the [[River]]. In some old star charts, his left hand holds a pendulum instead.
Queen|dwecRèc.¤dwac.¤Cassiopeia¤The Queen (Cassiopeia for us) is depicted in a sitting position, with the [[Rosebush]] at her feet.¶¶According to legend, she sent the [[Prince]] on a quest that started at her Rosebush; see there for more information.
King|Rèc.¤¤Cepheus & Ursa Minor (Polaris)¤This constellation corresponds to our Cepheus and represents the [[Queen]]’s husband. He is sitting on his throne, with the Pole Star as his head. He doesn’t come into the [[Rosebush]] legend much because he is more concerned with his birds, the [[Sparrow]] and the [[Swan]].
Dolphin|spÌsk.¤¤Delphinus¤The Dolphin corresponds to our constellation of the same name, Delphinus. It is in mid-jump, looking northeast.
Dragon|fxÌc.¤¤Draco & Ursa Minor¤The Dragon, or Draco in our nomenclature, is flying with his wings raised towards the North Pole, looking south at the [[Stag]] to challenge it. His left wing consists of the four stars that make up the body of Ursa Minor, the lesser bear, in our tradition.¶¶In one legend, the Dragon was defeated by a clever contraption of the Craftsman’s (now called the [[Mechanic]]); in another, he was a cursed boy who was healed by the [[Lion]].
Fishes|pyskdwÌ.¤pask.¤Pisces¤The Fishes (literally ‘two fish’) correspond to our constellation of the same name, Pisces. The two fish proper are located at the western and northern ends of the constellation; they are connected by two ribbons or leashes meeting at the star {{#6663|α Piscium (Alrescha)}}.
Horse|Ìhw.¤¤Pegasus¤The Horse is usually depicted as having wings and thus equated to the mythical Pegasus; although the wings might just symbolise its swiftness. For some reason it is upside down, and ist hind parts are missing.¶¶Some say this is the [[Prince]]’s horse.
River|argÌ.¤¤Eridanus & Fornax¤This constellation coincides with our river Eridanus, flowing south.¶¶{{#809|Dalim}}, the main star of the constellation Fornax (the furnace) is located in a loop of the River. It is often depicted as a house or tree at the top of a hill.
Charioteer|rèt.¤¤Auriga¤The Charioteer (literally ‘steerer’) corresponds to our constellation Auriga. His chariot is drawn by the [[Bull]]. He is carrying a goat ({{#648|α Aurigae or Capella}}) and her three kids (the triangle formed by the stars {{#102859|ε}}, {{#66442|ζ}} and {{#13814|η}} Aurigae just south of Capella).¶¶The goat Capella is said to have breast-fed the [[Wise One]] when he was an infant.
Hare|xÌd.¤¤Lepus¤The Hare, or Lepus in our star charts, is located south of the [[Hunter]]. It is facing west, fleeing from the [[Poodle]]. Three stars surrounding the image of the Hare, {{#4627|Sceptrum}}, {{#2243|ζ}} and {{#954|η Leporis}}, represent bees stirred up by its flight.
Poodle|oRwxÌf.¤¤Canis Major¤The Poodle is the [[Hunter]]’s dog and corresponds to Canis Major, the greater dog. It is on its hind legs, looking northwest at its master and the fleeing [[Hare]].¶¶This is the proper breed of dog for hunting along the [[River]].
Thimble|wzinskrùc.¤wza.¤small part of Centaurus, Crux & Musca¤The Thimble was named by the first Europeans to sail the southern oceans, along with the [[Bridge]], the [[Elephant]], the [[Flamingo]], the [[Hummingbird]], the [[Ivory Tower]], the [[Jaguar]], the [[Kangaroo]], the [[Loom and Shuttle]], the [[Seal]], and the [[Shark]].¶¶It is a small constellation located at the rear end of the [[Centaur]], its top pointing north, and incorporating stars from our constellations Crux (the cross) and Musca (the fly).¶¶In a story about the [[Ship]], its crew uses the Thimble to hunt down a legendary creature, but they are thwarted by the [[Boojum]].
Lion|lÌw.¤¤Leo¤This is the Lion, or Leo as we call the constellation, who killed the [[Witch]]. It is depicted as a male lion in resting poise, looking west.
Hunter|krèt.¤¤Orion¤The Hunter corresponds to our constellation Orion. His sword is hanging from his belt, he is holding a hunting bow and has his [[Poodle]] by his side. Stories disagree about what he is holding in his raised hand.
Prince|textèx.¤taxt.¤Perseus¤According to legend, the Prince (Perseus in our tradition) was sent on a quest by the [[Queen]] that started at her [[Rosebush]]; see there for more information.¶¶He is depicted with a high crown and the [[Princess]]’s departure presents in his hands: a mask and a dead snake.
Trumpet|saxùf.¤¤Sagitta¤The Trumpet corresponds to our constellation Sagitta, the arrow. According to legend, the Craftsman (now the constellation [[Mechanic]]) threw the it across the whole sky and into the [[River]] because it didn’t sound as good as he had hoped.
Squirrel|ksmÌs.¤¤Lynx & Leo Minor¤The squirrel is a rather faint constellation to the south of the [[Bear]], covering the region of our Leo Minor (the lesser lion) and part of Lynx. It is scurrying nimbly eastwards with its bushy tail raised, bringing the [[Mechanic]] a nut.
Serpent|RÌz.¤¤Serpens¤This is the [[Wise One]]’s serpent (Serpens in our nomenclature), which he holds in his hands. It is the symbol of his wisdom. The Serpent’s head is at the western end; it is looking threateningly northeast towards the [[Stag]], completely ignoring the [[Mechanic]]. The Wise One’s other animal is the [[Eagle]].
Archer|fkrè.¤¤Sagittarius¤The Archer, or Sagittarius as we call this constellation, is usually depicted as a girl with an elaborate feathered headdress. She is aiming west at the [[Scorpion]], more accurately at the star Antares, which is known as the Apple Star (<span lang="x-lm" title="memthxxalè.">memqxxalè.</span>) for its reddish colour.
Swan|xaxpqÌ.¤¤Cygnus¤This is the [[King]]’s swan, which we call Cygnus. It is flying in a southwesterly direction and has lost five feathers ({{#27813|ν}}, {{#86290|ξ}}, {{#91656|ο¹}}, {{#83732|ο²}} and {{#2118|τ Cygni}}) for the [[Prince]] to pick up. The King’s other bird is the [[Sparrow]].¶¶A number of heroes and gods were transformed into swans, or transformed themselves for various reasons. Many of these have been identified with the Swan by classical authors.
Scorpion|plUpÌ.¤¤Scorpius & Libra¤The Scorpion consists of our constellations Scorpius and Libra (the weighing scales). In some stories, it is killed by the [[Archer]], in others, it is confronted by the [[Prince]] (who is on his quest to win the [[Princess]]’s hand), or by both. The fact that the Archer is female and also of royal blood only serves to complicate things.¶¶Antares, {{#52332|α Scorpii}}, is called the Apple Star (<span lang="x-lm" title="memthxxalè.">memqxxalè.</span>) in the Lemizh tradition.
Ibex|kubrÌ.¤¤Capricornus¤The Ibex, Capricornus in our nomenclature, is actually a goat–fish hybrid that has been haunting European legends for a long time.
Bull|strÌ.¤¤Taurus¤The [[Charioteer]]’s Bull is identical to our constellation Taurus. It is looking towards the viewer, one forefoot raised, horns pointing northeast.¶¶Star numbers starting with <span lang="x-lm" title="B">B</span> were originally assigned to the [[Guests]] or Pleiades, which is now a separate constellation. Therefore, there are no such numbers in the Bull.
Whale-fish|gydpÌsk.¤gad.¤Cetus¤This constellation, which corresponds to Cetus, is a sea monster whose shape is quite different from that of a whale: it has a bulky head (looking east), a slim neck, and long flippers.
Merman|zrOnyÌx.¤zrOna.¤Aquarius & Equuleus¤The Merman corresponds mostly to our constellation Aquarius, but also includes Equuleus (the foal) and {{#170|Fomalhaut}}, the main star of Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish). It is holding a cup ({{#8261|γ}}, {{#10572|η}} and {{#83386|π Aquarii}}) that is overflowing with water, soaking the last three in the [[Queue of Mice]].¶¶According to one story, the Merman was capured by the [[Eagle]] and made the gods’ cupbearer to keep him from drenching unsuspecting animals.
Twins|dwjÌw.¤¤Gemini¤The Twins, or Gemini as we call them, are holding the [[Crab]] by one of its hind legs to keep it from holding up the [[Runner]].

Crab|krÌb.¤¤Cancer¤The Crab, which we call Cancer, is facing east with its pincers extended. The [[Twins]] have caught it by one of its hind legs to keep it from pinching the [[Squirrel]] or, following another legend, from holding up the [[Runner]].
Robin|krystrÙjd.¤krast.¤Corvus & Hydra¤The Robin, what we know as Corvus or the raven, is flying to the east, with its tail tilted to the southwest. It is thought to be a bird of guidance.
Cup|gwalpÌ.¤¤Crater¤The Cup equals our constellation Crater, which also represents a cup. Its foot is at the southwestern end.
Witch|trèw.¤¤Virgo¤The Witch is the constellation we call Virgo, the virgin. She is depicted as driving in a sledge in a southeasterly direction. The star {{#1634|μ Virginis}} is the tip of her whip.¶¶Legend has it that she commissioned the craftsman (the [[Mechanic]]) to make her a crown and a [[Trumpet]], and that she later quarreled with the [[Lion]] and was killed by him.
Moth|swmilÌ.¤¤Canes Venatici & Coma Berenices¤The Moth roughly covers the region of Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices, the hunting dogs and Berenice’s hair. It used to be seen as a swarm of moths or fireflies (the Coma Cluster) flying around the [[Mechanic]] and making fun of him. Only later the constellation has been reinterpreted as one, somewhat oversized, moth flying east.
Ram|edÌ.¤¤Aries¤The Ram, literally called ‘the sheep’, corresponds to our Aries, the golden-woolled ram whose fleece was stolen by the Argonauts (see the [[Ship]]). It is depicted lying down and with exaggerated horns, looking west.
Wise One|mèv.¤¤Ophiuchus¤This is a wise, pale man corresponding to our constellation Ophiuchus, the serpent bearer. He is carrying his staff and [[Serpent]] and has the [[Eagle]] by his side.¶¶See the constellation [[Rosebush]] for his role in the [[Prince]]’s quest.
Stag|prÌxt.¤¤Lyra & Hercules¤This contellation, literally ‘the red deer’, depicts a stag running southeast. Its head and antlers correspond to our constellation Lyra, its body roughly to Hercules. It is often seen as a representation of the White Stag, which will grant you a wish if you catch it, but only after it has led you into forbidden territory.¶¶The [[Dragon]] and the [[Serpent]] are looking in the direction of the (completely unfazed) Stag to challenge it, or maybe, in case of the Serpent, to avoid looking at the [[Mechanic]].
Beaver|trÌxk.¤¤Hydra & Canis Minor¤The Beaver consists of our constellation Canis Minor (the lesser dog) and the front part of Hydra (the female water snake). It is facing west along with the [[Lion]] and the [[Tortoise]], while his [[Pipe]] is behind his back.
Centaur|mRÌkh.¤¤Centaurus & Crux¤The Centaur encompasses our constellations Centaurus and Crux, the cross. He is looking east at the [[Witch]]’s [[Wolf]], which he has slain.¶¶He is often identified with the healer Cheiron or Cairon.

Mermaid|zrOnÌ.¤¤Cassiopeia, Camelopardalis & Lynx¤This is a large but faint constellation spanning the region of Camelopardalis and Lynx, the giraffe and, well, lynx. It is swimming west in the direction of the [[King]] and [[Queen]].
Sparrow|stnÌt.¤¤Camelopardalis¤The Sparrow, in the region of Camelopardalis’, the giraffe’s, head, is depicted as flying to the [[King]]’s hands. The King’s other bird is the [[Swan]].
Ship|Ìkh.¤¤Carina, Vela & Puppis¤The Ship is sailing northeast in the region of our ship Argo, which consists of the constellations Carina (keel), Vela (sails) and Puppis (poop deck). The Lemizh Ship, however, is considerably smaller.¶¶It has been identified with various mythological ships that went on great voyages, including the Argo whose crew stole the [[Ram]]’s golden fleece, one ship that went to the world’s eastern edge, one that went north into the ice, one that got lost in time among the stars, and one with a more convoluted story involving the [[Thimble]] and the [[Boojum]].
Artichoke|qkrÌdj.¤¤Vulpecula¤This is the artichoke the [[King]] forgot to buy because he was busy feeding his birds, the [[Swan]] and the [[Sparrow]].¶¶Our constellation Vulpecula, the little fox, – between the Swan and the [[Dolphin]] – roughly corresponds to the Artichoke.
Lynx|lÌxh.¤¤Aquarius & Cetus¤The Lemizh Lynx is unrelated to our constellation of the same name. It sits behind the [[Whale-fish]] and looks west in the direction of the [[Merman]].
Pipe|qentù.¤¤Leo, Sextans & Hydra¤This is not a pipe but a constellation located to the south of the [[Lion]]. According to myth, it belongs to the [[Beaver]]. It includes the area of our constellation Sextans (the sextant) and also overlaps with Leo (the lion) and Hydra (the female water snake).
Queue of Mice|sriqmÌs.¤sraq.¤Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus, Indus & Sculptor¤This constellation represents the Chief Mouse ({{#4173|α Indi}} in our nomenclature) leading his eleven warriors. It lies to the south of the [[Merman]] and the [[Ibex]] and passes our constellations Indus (the Indian), Microscopium (the microscope), Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish), and Sculptor.¶¶The [[Merman]] is pouring water over the last three mice in the Queue.

Runner|nenÌ.¤¤Puppis, Pyxis, Antlia & Hydra¤This man, to be found just east of the [[Poodle]], is running westwards around the sky, perpetually following the [[Tortoise]] (more or less). The constellation roughly corresponds to our Pyxis (the mariner’s compass) and Antlia (the air pump), and also overlaps with parts of Puppis (the poop deck) and Hydra (the female water snake).
Boojum|bucmÌ.¤¤Centaurus, Antlia & Vela¤The Boojum is a legendary creature. It is depicted as looking towards the viewer. A large but faint contellation, it is situated in the region of Centaurus, Antlia (the air pump) and Vela (the ship’s sails).¶¶According to legend, looking at the Boojum can cause you to disappear, as happened to one of the [[Ship]]’s crew.
Monkey|RenÌj.¤¤Carina & Vela¤The Monkey is located in the region of Carina (the ship’s keel) and Vela (the sails). It is depicted in a sitting position, looking towards the viewer, its tail curling to the south.¶¶If you meet the Monkey, you have to play a game of dice against him; one that may never end.
Tiara|dirÌ.¤¤Corona Australis¤The Tiara is our Corona Australis (the southern crown). It lies at the feet of the [[Archer]].¶¶It is often drawn as made of vine leaves, honouring Dionysos’s mother.

Rosebush|drulygwrÌjd.¤drula.¤part of Cassiopeia¤This constellation represents the [[Queen]]’s rosebush. Traditionally, it consists of the roughly oval shape that is created by a dust cloud in front of the Milky Way, or ‘street of snow’, whose beginning the Rosebush marks. (The part of the Milky Way to the east of the Rosebush is to faint to be seen clearly.) The stars are the rose blooms.¶¶The [[Prince]]’s journey on the street of snow to win the [[Princess]]’s hand, it is said, began here. When he arrived at a fork in the street, he had to choose between the southern, brighter path, which led to the [[Scorpion]], and the northern, dimmer path, which led to the [[Wise One]]. Stories disagree about which path he took.

It is part of what we call Pavo, the peacock.
Guests|ivdmlì.¤avd.¤Taurus (Pleiades)¤The group of Guests, which we know as the Pleiades or seven sisters, are approaching the viewer from the distance. This is why this is one of the smallest constellations.¶¶{{#10334|A¹ Tauri}} represents the guest who wants to be left alone to enjoy her solitude.
Sickle|yhlùgz.¤¤Norma¤The Sickle covers the nondescript region south of the [[Scorpion]] which we know as Norma (the set square or possibly ruler). Its handle is pointing north.
